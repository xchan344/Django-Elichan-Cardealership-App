# Installation

1. Fork the Repository From [xchan344](https://github.com/xchan344/Laravel-Elichan-Cardealership-App) github repositories

2. To install Django, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Set Up Python

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Django requires Python 3.6 or higher. You can check your Python version by running the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

```
python --version
```


Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)
It's a good practice to create a virtual environment for each Django project. A virtual environment allows you to isolate dependencies and avoid conflicts between different projects.

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the desired directory where you want to create your project. Then, run the following command to create a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv myenv
```

Replace `myenv` with the name you want to give to your virtual environment.

Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment
After creating the virtual environment, activate it by running the appropriate command for your operating system:

For Windows:
```
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

For macOS/Linux:
```
source myenv/bin/activate
```

Step 4: Install Django
Once the virtual environment is activated, you can proceed to install Django using the package manager called pip. Run the following command:

```
pip install Django
```

This command will download and install the latest version of Django and its dependencies.

Step 5: Verify the Installation
To verify that Django has been installed successfully, you can run the following command:

```
python -m django --version
```

If Django is installed correctly, you should see the version number displayed.

That's it! Django should now be installed on your system. You can start creating your Django projects and applications using the installed framework. Remember to activate your virtual environment whenever you work on a Django project.

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) - For the Virtual Environment

    To install Python on your computer, you can follow these general steps:

1. Visit the official Python website: Go to the Python website at https://www.python.org/ and navigate to the Downloads section.

2. Choose the Python version: Python has multiple versions available, but it is recommended to install the latest stable version. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Python 3.x is the most recent major version. However, it's possible that a newer version may be available at the time you're reading this. Click on the appropriate download link for the version you want to install.

3. Select the installer: You will see different installer options based on your operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS, or Linux). Choose the installer that matches your operating system. For Windows, you may also have the option to download either the 32-bit or 64-bit version. If you're unsure, the 64-bit version is typically recommended if your system supports it.

4. Download the installer: Click on the download link for the installer file, and your browser will start downloading the file. Wait for the download to complete.

5. Run the installer: Once the installer file is downloaded, locate it on your computer and double-click on it to run the installer.

6. Customize the installation (optional): The Python installer will provide some installation options. You can customize the installation location and choose whether to add Python to the system's PATH variable (recommended). Adding Python to the PATH allows you to run Python from any command prompt or terminal window.

7. Start the installation: Click on the "Install Now" button or any similar option to start the installation process. The installer will copy the necessary files and set up Python on your computer. This process may take a few minutes.

8. Verify the installation: After the installation is complete, you can verify if Python was installed correctly. Open a command prompt or terminal window and type `python --version` (or `python3 --version` on some systems) and press Enter. You should see the installed Python version displayed.
